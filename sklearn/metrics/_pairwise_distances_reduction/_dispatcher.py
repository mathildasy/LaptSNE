            For both strategies the computations happens with two nested loops,
            respectively on chunks of X and chunks of Y.
            Strategies differs on which loop (outer or inner) is made to run
            in parallel with the Cython `prange` construct:

              - 'parallel_on_X' dispatches chunks of X uniformly on threads.
                Each thread then iterates on all the chunks of Y. This strategy is
                embarrassingly parallel and comes with no datastructures
                synchronisation.

              - 'parallel_on_Y' dispatches chunks of Y uniformly on threads.
                Each thread processes all the chunks of X in turn. This strategy is
                a sequence of embarrassingly parallel subtasks (the inner loop on Y
                chunks) with intermediate datastructures synchronisation at each
                iteration of the sequential outer loop on X chunks.

              - 'auto' relies on a simple heuristic to choose between
                'parallel_on_X' and 'parallel_on_Y': when `X.shape[0]` is large enough,
                'parallel_on_X' is usually the most efficient strategy.
                When `X.shape[0]` is small but `Y.shape[0]` is large, 'parallel_on_Y'
                brings more opportunity for parallelism and is therefore more efficient
                despite the synchronization step at each iteration of the outer loop
                on chunks of `X`.

              - None (default) looks-up in scikit-learn configuration for
                `pairwise_dist_parallel_strategy`, and use 'auto' if it is not set.

        return_distance : boolean, default=False
            Return distances between each X vector and its
            argkmin if set to True.

        Returns
